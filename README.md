BTS Cloud Computing student at Lycée Guillaume Kroll I’m passionate about IT infrastructure, networks, and automation. My goal is to start my career as a junior cloud or system engineer, and keep developing my skills in security, DevOps, and modern infrastructure. On this website, you’ll find my skills, projects, and CV in multiple languages.
